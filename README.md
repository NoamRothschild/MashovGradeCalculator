This project was created in order to practice skills learned in [HackTheBox's Web Requests module](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/35), which teaches *the fundementals of web requests*, essentially for free, and is recommended by me for anyone who is interested to start learning [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network).
